# COSC1430_Lab24

For this assignment, you're given a partially completed class RadioStation. Complete it's following methods:

    void setName(string): check if the string is empty. If it is then throw an std::runtime_error with this message:

      -Station name must not be empty!
      -otherwise, set the name to that new string. 
      -This function is provided to you as a reference for the implementation of the functions below.

    void setChannel(float): check if the float is negative, or more than 100 and throw an std::runtime_error with the following message:

      -Invalid channel!
      -otherwise, set the channel to that new float

    void setBandwidth(int): check if the int is negative and throw an std::runtime_error with the following message:

      -Bandwidth must be a positive number!
      -otherwise, set the bandwidth to that new int

    void broadcast(string): check if the string is empty and throw an std::runtime_error with the following message:

      -Message must not be empty!
      -Then, check if bandwidth is not positive and throw an std::runtime_error with the following message:
      -Insufficient Bandwidth!
      -otherwise, print out the message and decrement the bandwidth

    A constructor that takes in (name, channel, bandwidth), make sure to call the setter functions (setName, setChannel,â€¦) so that the exception checking is effective!

Main.cpp

    In the main function, surround each of the indicated (commented) blocks of code with a try catch block that catches the runtime_error and print out it's message with error.what().
